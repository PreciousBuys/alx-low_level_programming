more pointers, arrays and strings

task 0
-write a function that concatenates two strings
-This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte

task 1
-write a function that concatenates two strings
-The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest

task 2
-writes a function that copies  a string

task 3
-writes a function that compares two strings

task 4
-writes a function that reverses the content of an array of integers
-Where n is the number of elements of the array

task 5
-Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

task 6
